**WARNING: Enter at Your Own Peril**

This project is a glorious Frankenstein's monster, stitched together from the dark magic of Flask and the questionable sentience of AI. It's the brainchild of yours truly (yes, the coding rockstar you see before you), so any complaints can be directed straight to my nonexistent inbox. 

**What This Thing (Hopefully) Does**

Look, if you need a dissertation on functionality, you've come to the wrong place. Let's just say it accomplishes tasks that would make even a Roomba blush. 

**Installation**

1. **Sacrifice a Small Mammal (Optional):** It might appease the AI gods and prevent random crashes. 
2. **Install Necessary Stuff (the Boring Way):** You know, the usual suspects: Python, Flask,NextJs and whatever else tickles your fancy. Google it, or better yet, ask someone who remembers.
3. **Clone This Repository:** Unless you enjoy typing for hours, use `git clone` like a civilized person.

**Running This Beast**

1. **Fire Up Your Terminal:** Because who needs a fancy GUI anyway? 
2. **Navigate:** Use those nifty `cd backend` commands to find your way here. 
3. **Make .env:** In Backend Folder `make .env fine cuz why the fuck i will give you my api key` 
4. **Run the Show:** Type `python app.py` (or whatever the main script is called) and pray nothing explodes.
5. **Navigate:** Use those nifty `cd frontend` commands to find your way here.  
6. **Run the Show:** Type `yarn run dev` (or whatever the main script is called) and pray nothing explodes. 


**Contributing**

Sure, you can "contribute." Just remember, your code better be legendary, or prepare to face my withering sarcasm. 

**Contact**

Unless you have pizza or beer, don't bother. But hey, if you insist:

* **WhatsApp:** **03283456348** (Only for emergencies involving pizza or beer)  *This phone number is real, please do not call just fucking text it.*
* **Gmail:** mohammadhadirauf@gmail.com (Use with caution. Response times may vary from geological epochs to never.)
